## 1. üìå Executive Summary

This software is a dedicated, single-tenant execution-layer solution built for a proprietary trading firm. It provides dynamic, rule-based trade manipulation tools that help reduce overexposure to high-risk or exploitative trader behavior. Integrated with major trading platforms (MT5, TradeLocker, DXTrade, cTrader, Match-Trader), the system applies configurable execution filters (slippage, skew, spread markup, delays, etc.) at the per-trader level.

It includes a secure admin dashboard for real-time trader monitoring, configuration, and performance analytics ‚Äî all aimed at helping the prop firm sustain long-term payouts, mitigate risk, and control the evaluation-to-funded pipeline more efficiently.
